# Task 2: Request for Proposal

**Aussie Business Buzz Integrated Management System**

## Introduction

ABB is one of the fastest-growing companies in its field. With four branch locations in Australia, Aussie Business Buzz (ABB) is a quickly expanding technology retail and service company. Proposals are being accepted for the creation and execution of an integrated management system, which will improve our customer service and expedite processes.

## System Description

**Customer Relations Database (CRD)**

Keep detailed customer information that includes contact details, purchase history, as well as device maintenance records.

Track the progress of device repairs, including complaint reports, job details, and expected completion dates.

Facilitate interactions with clients by making purchase information and repair progress updates easily accessible.

**Marketing Automation System (MAS)**

Easily integrate with the CRD to take use of client information for focused marketing initiatives.

To connect with both current and prospective clients, make use of social networking sites, email marketing, and other internet platforms.

Give people access to tools for creating, monitoring, and analysing campaigns.

**Inventory Management System (IMS)**

Oversee the stock levels of accessories, repair parts, and merchandise at all ABB sites.

In order to guarantee product availability and avoid stockouts, use real-time stock tracking.

Reorder wholesaler orders automatically in accordance with preset reorder levels.

**Management Reporting System (MRS)**

Provide in-depth management reports that offer insights into inventory levels, consumer behaviour, and sales trends.

Give users instant access to key performance indicators (KPIs) so they can make well-informed decisions.

Enable cross-ABB comparisons to pinpoint areas in need of strategic planning and enhancement.

## Proposal Evaluation

ABB will evaluate the different proposals based on functionality, cost efficiency, scalability, relevance, and capability.

**Functionality:** The system must have the ability to meet all the expected functionalities provided in the agreement.

**Cost efficiency:** The system must be developed and operated with the least possible cost while providing a high value. This includes training costs, operation costs, and maintenance costs of the system.

**Scalability:** The system must be able to support future feature implementation with minimal change requests or be integration-ready.

**Relevance:** All system features and components must be relevant to the business needs.

**Capability:** Developers or vendors must demonstrate a strong technological background and have a good reputation for meeting expectations and deadlines.

## Answering Questions

ABB will provide dedicated channels and communication in order to respond to proposers. The channels provided will also be used to update proposers any updates regarding the approval or rejection of their proposals, as well as any further questions needed for clarification or any feature improvements.

## Additional Information: 

ABB is to consider software development, SaaS solutions  or any existing application and component based solution.

The proposed proposal has to be seamless with the existing system and website.
ABB is commited to long term partnership with the vendor future training and maintenanace.

# Task 3: Software Development Methods, Processes and Techniques

## Introduction

In recent years, there has been a notable shift in the software development landscape from traditional, linear processes to more adaptable, iterative approaches. This trend is the result of a growing understanding that software development is a dynamic and intrinsically complicated process that calls for techniques flexible enough to adapt to change and unpredictability. Because Scrum performs so well at managing complicated projects, it has become one of the most popular agile frameworks. The decision between Scrum and Waterfall, a conventional linear technique, is contingent upon the particular requirements and characteristics of the project at hand.

**Agile Mindset**

An agile mindset requires teams to have teamwork, prototyping, customer collaboration, and continuous development. Teamwork allows individual teams to collaborate and provide the necessary work to complete certain tasks. Prototyping allows customers to see how the development process is done and provides customers with the look and feel of the software as it progresses. Customer collaboration allows for customer feedback to be implemented in order to align the customer’s needs with the software requirements. Continuous development will enable software developers to realign priorities and provide the necessary changes provided by the design team and customers. 

**Scrum Process Description**

Scrum represents an incremental and iterative paradigm that divides the software development process into brief, time-limited units known as sprints. A cross-functional team works together to produce a functional software increment during each sprint. Among the essential ideas of Scrum are:

* Teams are encouraged in such a way to make decisions on their own
* Every decision taken will be on the basis of evidence and from gathering feedback
* Teams will always evolve by reflecting and by making their processes more efficient which helps in overall performance 

**Waterfall Methodology Description**

The software development lifecycle is divided into discrete parts by the Waterfall technique, which takes an organised, sequential approach. These phases are requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Before going on to the next phase, each one must be finished, guaranteeing a clear plan and advance preparation. However, it may be difficult to adjust this inflexible framework to evolving needs or unanticipated events. This process is mostly used in cases where the project has upfront planning and where the customer Involvement is low. 

## Guidelines for Determining Software Development Methodology

Some factors to determine whether a scrum or waterfall approach is required includes:

**Timeline**

When a project requires a more fixed timeline, waterfall methodology will be a preferred compared to scrum. Due to certain projects requiring to have a definitive features and finish date, some projects would require a waterfall approach. On the other hand, scrum methodology allows a more flexible timeline which can change depending on the system requirements as the software development cycle progresses.

**Flexibility**

Projects which have strict and definitive requirements are more likely to adopt a waterfall methodology, due to the waterfall’s nature of having a linear development cycle. While agile provides a more flexible software development cycle, client feedback enables developers to realign software development requirements to fit client’s needs.

**Collaboration**

If clients are more involved throughout the development process, scrum methodology would be preferred. In waterfall development, clients are less likely to be involved and teams are more concerned about their specific tasks. In a scrum development, developers and clients collaborate on the software to determine whether changes are needed, and clients would be able to assess whether the software developed is aligned with the client’s needs.
